# Before start

If you still can't solve the problem, please contact us through in-app "Help and support".

# Specific device issues

* **Album is empty in "WeChat" app**

  If other redirected applications work properly, you may need to try to clear the data of "WeChat" and **enable "WeChat"'s storage permission manually from app info**. (We have not yet been able to reproduce the problem)

### Specific device issues

* **Does not work on Huawei EMUI**

  EMUI presets log off, and "store redirects" rely on logcat for information. Please ask yourself how to enable log on EMUI.

* **Does not work on Samsung S7 Edge**

  Please download arm version (you may need to uninstall current version) from [our website](https://rikka.app/storage_redirect/) and **disable auto update in Play store**.

### General problems

* **Redirected apps still generate files**

  Try [Enhance module](https://rikka.app/StorageRedirect/docs/en-US/?doc=enhanced)

* **Unable to find file in redirected app**

  Please check if the file is in "Non-redirect folders". Redirected app is not able to access files not in "Non-redirect folders". (See [About redirect](https://rikka.app/storage_redirect/docs/en/?doc=About%20redirect) for detail)

  If the file is not in "Non-redirect folders", please move it to "Non-redirect folders", or change "Non-redirect folders" setting,

  Magic: If the setting is correct but still can't find file, you may need to try to clear the data of the app ï¼ˆoptional?) and disable and enable the app's storage permission manually from app info.


* **Unable to open file from redirected app**

  > Example: "Open with other app" in "WeChat" app will get "unable to open file"

  This is a problem of redirected app, passing file path to other apps. To other app, the file path is wrong.

  To solve this problem, please use [Link](https://rikka.app/storage_redirect/docs/en/?doc=About%20link) feature.

  A notification will show when new file created if the correct rule is added.
  At this time, just tap the notification to open app. (Most popular apps already have user-submitted rules, just add them)

  > Example: Correct way to open files received by "WeChat" app
  >
  > ![Correct way to open](./../en/images/open_with_0.png)

  Files can also be found through the system's "File" (DocumentUI) app .

  > Example: Finding a received file using the Files app
  >
  > !["File" app](./../en/images/open_with_1.png)

* **Unable to share to redirected app**

  This is due to design issues with redirected app (and possibly the sharing app).

  Please download our [Bridge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.bridge) app to use his "Forward share" feature to solve this problem. (You can also wait for us for other solution)
