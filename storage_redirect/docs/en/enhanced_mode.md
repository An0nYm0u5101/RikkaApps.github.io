## About module v17 

The version 17 of the module introduces working method, using `socket`, no longer relying on `logcat`. This means that there will be no longer problems on some of the devices with `logcat` problems.

However, the reliability of this new working method (2019/2/7) has not been widely verified and cannot be guaranteed to be available on your device. If you have problems (such as can't open redirected apps), you can temporarily use [v16](https://github.com/RikkaApps/StorageRedirect-assets/releases/download/assets/magisk-riru-storage-redirect-arm-arm64-v16.zip) Module to get back to the previous working mode.
