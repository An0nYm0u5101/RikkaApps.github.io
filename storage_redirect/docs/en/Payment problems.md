# Pricing policy

In principle, the price will only go up but not down (excluding short-term discount event), and there will be no additional charges for existing features.

# Refund policy

If you need a refund, please send your purchase credentials (Google Play channel is the order number starting with GPA, Google will send it with email to the account purchases; other channels are redeem codes) to [support@rikka.app](mailto:support@rikka.app). You also need to provide a reason for the refund in the mail. Whether or not the refund will eventually be decided by the reason, the purchase time, etc. We will not respond to emails that do not provide sufficient information.

# Google Play purchase issues

In most cases, follow the prompts that appear after clicking the purchase button. If you still can't solve the problem, please send an email to us.
