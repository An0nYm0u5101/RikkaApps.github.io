### Why can't I find some permissions?

The App Ops app only modifies the appops settings in Android system, not the actual "permision management." Therefore, the items that App Ops can modify **are not related to permissions that can be seen in the app details**.

Items App Ops can modified only depend on your system (**so we have no ability and it is not possible to add our own items**), the higher the system version, the more content that can be modified (vendor or custom ROM may add its own items). All ypur system supported items can be found in Settings - Behavior - All Permissions.
